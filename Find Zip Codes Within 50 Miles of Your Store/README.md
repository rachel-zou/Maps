# Project Purpose

Suppose you have a list of stores and you want to define your service area as a radius of 50 miles within each store.
We want to find out all the zip codes falling into this 50-mile radius. If a zip code is within 50 miles of multiple stores,
we want to know which store is the closest one to that zip code, and the distance between the zip code and the store.

# What you will need to run the code

- You can download the zip codes information from the National Bureau of Economic Research's ZIP Code Distance Database: 
http://data.nber.org/data/zip-code-distance-database.html, which gives you all the zip code pairs that are within 50 miles of each other.
- You will prepare another spreadsheet which has a list of your home store zip codes.
